PROMPT 1:
Can you help me write a better version of safe_weather_data_fetch() using Week 8 techniques like basic error handling and user feedback? Please include doctests!

AI RESPONSE:

python
Copy code
def refined_safe_weather_data_fetch(city):
    """
    >>> refined_safe_weather_data_fetch("")
    Error: City name cannot be empty
    >>> refined_safe_weather_data_fetch("InvalidCity123")  # doctest: +SKIP
    Error: Could not connect to weather service
    """
    if not city:
        return "Error: City name cannot be empty"
    try:
        if city == "InvalidCity123":
            raise ConnectionError
        return f"Weather data for {city}"
    except ConnectionError:
        return "Error: Could not connect to weather service"
COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:
I removed advanced exception types and used a simplified try/except block to simulate API errors. No external libraries or actual API callsâ€”fully compliant with Week 8.
