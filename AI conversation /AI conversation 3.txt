PROMPT 1:
Can you help me compare my updated function with the ideal solution? Mention similarities, differences, course concept links, and improvement ideas using our course terms.

AI RESPONSE:

Similarities: Both validate inputs, give clear feedback

Differences: The ideal uses real API + precise errors; mine uses basic mock data

Course connection: Demonstrates Week 8 error-handling mindset

Improvement idea: Add string format checks, consistent error messages (per Chapter 6, Lab 8)

COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:
The AI suggested checking for alphabetic charactersâ€”I'll apply that using only basic string methods. Avoided real API usage and restricted feedback to Week 8 logic.
