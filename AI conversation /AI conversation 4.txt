PROMPT 1:
Help me manually implement a task manager using Week 4–6 techniques only (lists, loops, validation). Include doctests where possible.

AI RESPONSE:

Used display_menu(), get_user_choice() and main() with loops and list operations

Applied simple input validation for menu choices

Sample doctests were skipped per Week 9 style

COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:
Stripped out any try/except logic that wasn't simple. Stuck to Week 4-6 concepts: list .append(), for loops, basic input checking. Didn’t use OOP, file I/O, or external libraries.
