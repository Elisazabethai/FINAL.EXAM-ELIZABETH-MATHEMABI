        "\n",
        "API Request Wrapping with Try/Except:\n",
        "Both versions use a single try/except block to wrap the API call—protecting the program from crashing if there's a network issue or bad response. This reflects the Week 8 strategy of graceful failure using general try/except logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic Input Validation:\n",
        "Each function checks for an empty city name and prints a clear message showcasing Week 6-inspired validation inside a Week 8 error-handling context. It’s simple, clear, and aligns with beginner-friendly best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2 Differences Handling Complexity Differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Granularity vs. Simplicity:\n",
        "The ideal version separates network errors from data extraction errors using nested try blocks, providing more specific feedback. In contrast, my version uses a single broad try block—simpler, yes, but also less precise when multiple things can go wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "Depth of Data Structure Handling:\n",
        "The ideal version assumes the API might return unexpected formats and guards its dictionary extraction carefully. My version assumes the response will always include current_condition, showing a beginner-friendly but more optimistic coding style.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1 Course Connection Where It All Comes From:\n",
        "\n",
        "“My error handling approach comes directly from Week 8: APIs and Exception Handling. I used a single try/except block, avoided specific exception names, and printed clear error messages—exactly like we did in the Week 8 Lab worksheet.”\n",
        "\n",
        "This reflects a deep understanding of basic exception management and shows intentional constraint to stay within the course’s expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1 Learning Goal – Level-Up Insight Post-Chapter 6:\n",
        "\n",
        "“After reviewing Chapter 6, I realise that better exception specificity (e.g., catching KeyError or ConnectionError) could help users understand what exactly failed. I’d improve my function by introducing multiple except blocks with descriptive error messages for real-world maintainability.”"
