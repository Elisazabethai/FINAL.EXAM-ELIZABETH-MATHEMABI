4.2 Course-Connected Reflection (10 marks
1. Workflow Balance with Course Learning

Using the Human-AI Workflow Strategy from Week 1: Getting Started with Python and AI, I divided the task into two parts. I handled the planning phase manually by writing pseudocode, structuring the task manager logic, and identifying validation points as laid out in the "Human Leads, AI Supports" slide. The AI was mainly to clarify syntax, not design, leaving me in control of my logic while minimizing low-level errors. This is also in line with the course philosophy that views AI as a productivity tool, rather than a creative alternative, especially for the transfer of logic into functions.

2. Course Concept 
The "Error Handling Mindset" from Week 6 was applied in the writing of the function called remove task(). I put the input conversion in a try/except clause to catch unexpected values that would prevent any crashing. I applied this [defensive programming from] week 5 [to the] list tasks() and remove task() functions by making sure the task list is not empty before trying to go through the list or modify it. These habits made testing smoother when the docket was run by reducing failure points that would have labelled this activity as inefficient due to the course's more proactive approach to finding edge cases before they could occur. 

3. Learning Transfer
I will undergo the iterative fine-tuning process that I learned in week 7 by segmenting my final project into attainable milestones. One of my important improvements will be based on the feedback received for Assignment 2, and it will be on my input validation technique. I did not actually cover some edge cases before, but input-handling will now be refined-and even more test passes will be put in place to catch flaws early. This approach to looped testing very much resonates with the course theoretical-session on co-evolving code through small incremental changes.
