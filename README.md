Project Structure

 File  Purpose 
 `Mock_Exam.ipynb`  Contains all code, pseudocode, and tests from Sections 1–4 
 `conversation_log.txt`  Documents key AI prompts and responses 
`README.md` This file, summarizing the project structure and progress 

 Section Summaries

Section 1 Pseudocode & Planning
- Designed initial pseudocode for weather-fetching and task manager functions.
- Followed Week 3 and Week 4 logical structures with comments for clarity.
- Emphasis on beginner readability and clear control flow.

 Section 2  Iterative Debugging
- Identified logic issues with menu interaction and API fetch.
- Used print statements (Week 3/4 style) for tracing.
- Logged all fixes and improvements in `conversation_log.txt`.

 Section 3 Function Refinement
- Focused on basic error handling from Week 8 (try/except, no specific exception types).
- Implemented `refined_safe_weather_data_fetch(city)` with proper doctests.
- Avoided advanced exception handling, inline with mock exam constraints.

 Section 4 - Manual Implementation
- Used only Week 4–6 techniques:
  - `input()` and `print()` for UI
  - `while` loops for main program flow
  - Simple `if/else` for decision logic
- Implemented:
  - `display_menu()` – Week 3-style printing
  - `get_user_choice()` – Week 6 input validation
  - `main()` – full task loop logic, no advanced features
- Included doctests for all testable functions, using Week 9 format.

Course Constraint Compliance
All functions:
- Use only content taught in Weeks 1–8 and 10
- Avoid:
  - Advanced Python libraries
  - Specific exception types
  - Custom classes or OOP logic
  - External tools or imports (unless approved in lectures)
    
 Learning Reflections
This mock exam pushed me to:
- Think algorithmically using pseudocode before implementation
- Practice safe, beginner-friendly error handling
- Build confidence with interactive programs using basic tools
- Respect the value of simplicity, reusability, and constraint-based coding

 What's Next?
I’m preparing for:
- Section 5 reflection
- Section 6 mini-project ideas
- Using feedback to refine my portfolio for future business analyst roles 

 Academic Integrity
- All work was done individually.
- AI interactions are logged and were used as an assistant, not a replacement.
- No collaboration with other students.
